This is a website for the Code Kentucky Bootcamp. There is a home page and a newsletter page. My website is based off of a fictional publishing company called West End Publsihers. There are seven sections on the home page: 
    <br>* A header and hero image.
    <br>* A new releases section. 
    <br>* An authors sections with their pictures and names.
    <br>* A trending now section to display the latest trends. 
    <br>* A sign up banner to sign up for the news letter.
    <br>* An upcoming events section to display events for authors. 
    <br>* A footer with contact info and other information.

The newsletter page is linked through the sign up now button.

Features to fullfil project requirements:
    <br>* Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. (used throughout the page)
    <br>* Create a form, validate at least one field and then use that information on your page somehow. (used on the forms.html page)
    <br>* Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction. (used to show event descriptions by clicking       the 'learn more' button)
