This is a website for the Code Kentucky Bootcamp. There is a home page and a newsletter page. My website is based off of a fictional publishing company called West End Publsihers. There are seven sections on the home page: 
    A header and hero image.
    A new releases section. 
    An authors sections with their pictures and names.
    A trending now section to display the latest trends. 
    A sign up banner to sign up for the news letter.
    An upcoming events section to display events for authors. 
    A footer with contact info and other information.

The newsletter page is linked through the sign up now button.

Features to fullfil project requirements:
    Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. (used throughout the page)
    Create a form, validate at least one field and then use that information on your page somehow. (used on the forms.html page)
    Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction. (used to show event descriptions by clicking the 'learn more' button)
